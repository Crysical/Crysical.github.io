Hi this website is a way to explore and learn how websites work. My goal is to make a fully functioning art portfolio.

The main goal is to show off drawings with their name and the date uploaded to the website.
This webiste will have a way to organize and sort images by average color of pixels.
There will be a way to switch through different tabs of the website. For example a digital art tab and a traditional art tab.
I also want to be able to display images by clicking on them.

If you want to help make changes or edit things, feel free to contact me at hannarruby@gmail.com or message me through github.
